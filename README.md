# Voice-Agent
The Voice Agent Project is an intelligent voice-controlled assistant developed using Python. It listens to the userâ€™s voice commands, processes them, and performs various tasks automatically. The system uses speech recognition to understand spoken words and text-to-speech to respond back to the user in a natural voice.
